# matcha_maiko
Capstone project at VTech Fullstack Academy

  For the past 3 years, I have had the pleasure of working with Matcha Cafe Maiko Tysons.
Since their soft-opening day to their upcoming third year anniversary, I have seen and experienced this development first-hand.
However, without any KPIs or Data Dashboard to refer off of, it is hard to assess exactly how far we have come.
In this project, I hope to quantify the growth we've had during difficult pandemic times while providing various insights to stakeholders.

Objective: To present to business owners and stakeholders a comprehensive view on how the business has grown from 2019 to 2022 as well as attempt to present a predictive analysis on how sales will grow.

Methods: Analyze the sales as well as the items that were sold and draw connections to the year, season, menu items, and regulars to help provide insight. Utilize the Analytics features on tableau to show trendlines and forecasts.

Results: To be determined
