# matcha_maiko
Capstone project at VTech Fullstack Academy

For the past 3 years, I have had the pleasure of working with Matcha Cafe Maiko.
Since their soft-opening day to their upcoming third year anniversary, I have seen and experienced this development first-hand.
However, without any KPIs or Data Dashboard to refer off of, it is hard to assess exactly how far we have come.
In this project, I hope to quantify the growth we've had during difficult pandemic times while providing various insights to stakeholders.

Objective: To present to business owners and potential stakeholders a comprehensive view on how the business has grown from 2019 to 2022.

Methods: Analyze the sales as well as the items that were sold and draw connections to the year and season to help provide insight. Utilize the Analytics features on tableau to show trendlines and forecasts.

Results: Although Matcha Cafe Maiko Tysons experienced a prosperous beginning in 2019 with a whopping $200k in Q4 gross sales, things soon came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting February 2020, there is a sharp decline that starts to slowly recover starting May 2020. Even now, sales are not reaching the numbers they had initially hit, however, there is a constant upwards trend yearly, seasonally, and year over year growth. However, growth in 2022 is lacking, most likely due to potential customers traveling as pandemic international travel restrictions lift, reduced hours, and the abscense of Q4 data for 2022. This project will be updated quarterly.
